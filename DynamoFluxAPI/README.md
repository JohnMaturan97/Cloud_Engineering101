# Terraform Project Setup

Welcome to the Terraform project setup guide. This document will help you clone the project from GitHub, initialize Terraform, and manage your infrastructure efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed before proceeding:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - For version control and cloning the repository.
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) - For infrastructure automation.

## Setup Instructions

### Cloning the Repository

Begin by cloning the repository to get the necessary Terraform configuration files:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Execute the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   ```
   *Note: Replace `yourusername/yourrepository` with the actual path to your GitHub repository.*

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd yourrepository
   ```

### Initializing Terraform

Initialize Terraform to install the required plugins and prepare your environment:

```bash
terraform init
```

This command should be run in the directory containing your Terraform configuration files (`*.tf`).

### Configuring Terraform

Edit the Terraform configuration files as necessary:
- `main.tf` - Main configuration file.
- `variables.tf` - Defines variables used throughout the configuration.
- `outputs.tf` - Defines output values.

### Running Terraform

To see the planned changes and apply them to your infrastructure, use the following commands:

- **Plan** - Generate and show the execution plan:
  ```bash
  terraform plan
  ```
- **Apply** - Apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration:
  ```bash
  terraform apply
  ```

### Cleaning Up

To remove all resources managed by Terraform, execute:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
